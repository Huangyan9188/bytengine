LytPages tutorial
*****************

We are going to build a sample python web app with Bytengine on the backend.
This should give you a preview of one of the many ways you it can be used in your
your application stack.

Please feel free to translate this tutorial to your prefered language or framework
and share it with us `on twitter <https://twitter.com/bytengine>`_!

Synopsis
========

Our app is called LytPages and its a mini portal that offers users the opportunity to
show the world their script-fu! Each user gets a single page on which he/she can build
pretty much anything with CSS, HTML & Javascript using the built-in editor.

Building blocks and prerequisits
================================

LytPages will use with the following frameworks:

    * `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ 
    * `Codemirror <http://codemirror.net/>`_
    * `Bootstrap fork by Jasny <http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/index.html>`_
    * `JQuery <http://jquery.com/download/>`_
    
If you want to build and run LytPages, you'll need a local or remote Bytengine
instance which you can get by doing one of the following:

    * `Download a binary <https://github.com/johnwilson/bytengine#installation>`_
    * `Build your binary <https://github.com/johnwilson/bytengine#development>`_
    * Send a personal account request to bytengine[at]gmail.com
    * Use the test accounts (and hope nobody deletes your directories!)
